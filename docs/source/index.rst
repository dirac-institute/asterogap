AsteroGaP Documentation
=======================

AsteroGaP (Asteroid Gaussian Processes) is a Bayesian-based Gaussian Process model that seeks to fit sparsely-sampled asteroid light curves.

By utilizing a more flexible Gaussian Process framework for modeling asteroid light curves, we are able to represent light curves in a periodic but non-sinusoidal manner.
